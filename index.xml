      <description>I enjoy writing Clojure, a lot. I&amp;rsquo;ve written Javascript, PHP, Python, C, and Go. Clojure is by far the most satisfying language to write code and reason in. I keep coming back to it. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s the kind of people it attracts, alien ideas it encourages implementing things in, or simply personal biased preference, I don&amp;rsquo;t know.
That also extends to Clojurescript. Clojurescript and Clojure have been my first combo in writing front and back-end apps.</description>

      <description>NB: Code accompanying the post is on github.com/alex-glv/bunny-acme
The Problem While doing contract work optimizing and improving stability of an old PHP-based billing application I was constantly facing issues with long running processes that failed and couldn&amp;rsquo;t easily restore their state.
The actual process was performing daily billing services based on subscription rules.
The process would start, extract a whole bunch of information at once and start processing it one by one, withou keeping an intermediate progress results.</description>

      <title>Developing Golang in NixOS</title>

      <description>Why NixOS? The idea of fully reproducible system fascinates me a lot. Part of Getting Things Done philosophy is not to contaminate your head with the little things you have to do, you put them down on a list.
That&amp;rsquo;s why we use password managers, because you don&amp;rsquo;t want to keep all those password from a bazillion websites in your head - you trust something else to keep them. With you development environment it&amp;rsquo;s the same - you build your custom machine and when your drive goes bust, you go: &amp;ldquo;Oh, shit.</description>

      <title>Hugo on Amazon AWS Lambda integrated with GitHub</title>

      <description>The Problem I love static website generators. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great iteration over the old approach before dynamic websites became a de-facto standard.
The most compelling argument towards using static websites is &amp;ldquo;minimum-hosting&amp;rdquo; approach. The only thing you need is a web server and a domain name.
You still have the problem of continuos delivery. If you are anything like me, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to keep rebuilding and deploying your website manually.</description>

      <title>Containers are not real</title>

      <description>The advent of containers Containers seem to have turned the industry upside down and marching full ahead to become the dominant way of shipping software. To uninitiated mortals, Docker seems to be kind of a strange child. Where does it come from, what&amp;rsquo;s it good at? It looks like VM, but everyone keeps telling us not to compare it to VMs. Even though it gained a massive traction, it still has a long way to go to be a de-facto standard every developer should be familiar with.</description>

      <description>This website is called ItchyKnowsDevs. It&amp;rsquo;s a play on words Itchy Nose Developers. Which doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense either.
My name is Aleksandr Guljajev.
I reside in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I am a freelance software developer.
I love progress. I love learning. I love customizing and tailoring the tools I use. I love technology and innovation. I love tinkering, hacking and exploring. I hate most technologies, programming languages and operating systems.</description>

      <description>This website is a personal homepage.
The site is built with Hugoâ€”a static site generator made with Go. The website source code is available on GitHub. It uses the cocoa theme. The posts are written in Markdown.
The primary font face is Open Sans and the monospace font face is Ubuntu Mono. The social icons are from the Ionicons font set. CSS classes for code syntax highlighting are inserted during compile-time by Hugo using Pygments.</description>
